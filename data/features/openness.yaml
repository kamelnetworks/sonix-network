  Our commitment to open-source technology fosters innovation, collaboration, and community ownership. 

  We operate with full transparency, ensuring that our partners and the public have clear insight into our operations and finances. 

  As a non-profit, our focus is on serving the community to connect Sweden's internet infrastructure globally, not on generating profit.
