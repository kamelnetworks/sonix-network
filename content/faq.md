# Frequently Asked Questions
### How much does a port cost?

Nothing! All ports are currently for free.

However certain locations requires a one-time fee to cover our sponsors ODF cost:
 - Digital Realty Stockholm - 5740 SEK (~â‚¬500)

### Do you have Route Servers?

Yes, we do and encourage all peers to connect. Currently we only have a route server in the Stockholm location. We are currently working on deploying route servers to other sites.

### What best practices do you recommend?

We recommend:

- Ensure you are compliant with our [rules](/rules/).
- Setting the BGP timers to 3 second Keepalive and 9 second Hold. This helps in the event of a forwarding failure.
