      <description>Do you have any Route Servers? Not yet, we&amp;rsquo;re rolling out a new RS architecture that requires some more testing before it&amp;rsquo;s ready
What best practices do you recommend? We recommend:
Ensure you are compliant with our rules Setting the BGP timers to 3 second Keepalive and 9 second Hold. This helps in the event of a forwarding failure. What MTU is used? MTU 9000

      <description>TRex SONIX has a Cisco TRex running in Kista Gate. It can be accessed by SSH at speedtest.sonix.network for SONIX OPS.
Introduction TRex can run in a handful of modes, we run it in stateless mode. What this means to us is that TRex is a fast packet emitter that expects the packets it sends to return to the interface where it was sent. It does not care about anything related to sessions and not even neighbor discovery.</description>
