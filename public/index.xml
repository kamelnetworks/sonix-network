      <description>Do you have any Route Servers? Not yet, we&amp;rsquo;re rolling out a new RS architecture that requires some more testing before it&amp;rsquo;s ready
Do you allow Transit peering over the IX? As long as it&amp;rsquo;s settlement-free peering. E.g. free IPv6 transit is OK
What media do you support? 100G: 100GBASE-CWDM4, 100GBASE-LR4 (at extra cost)
40G: 40GBASE-LR4
25G: 25GBASE-LR
10G: 10GBASE-LR
Bring your own transceiver (BYOT) allowed? Yes! If it&amp;rsquo;s QSFP28 or QSFP+ compatible</description>

      <description>TRex SONIX has a Cisco TRex running in Kista Gate. It can be accessed by SSH at speedtest.sonix.network for SONIX OPS.
Introduction TRex can run in a handful of modes, we run it in stateless mode. What this means to us is that TRex is a fast packet emitter that expects the packets it sends to return to the interface where it was sent. It does not care about anything related to sessions and not even neighbor discovery.</description>
